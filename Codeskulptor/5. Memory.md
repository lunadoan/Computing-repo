Hello! 

In "Memory" game, you'll check if you have a photographic memory. For each turn, you'll reveal 2 cards. If the cards are the same, the cards will stay exposed. But if the cards are different, they will be flipped. Try to see if you can expose all the cards with the smallest number of turns. 

Restart buttons will restart the game over with new spread (think about spreading a card deck, this works the same, card positions will be different).
